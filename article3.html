        <p>Equipment
            Whole blood donations are collected using sterile 16G or 18G needles and sterile collection systems which contain an anticoagulant and preservative solution for long-term blood product storage. These collection systems also have access devices to allow for sterile sample collection for later testing, without accessing the blood component storage bag. Apheresis collections, including double red cell, plasma, and platelet collection procedures, utilize technology which collects blood from the donor, processes it in a centrifuge, and retains the product of interest while returning the remaining blood components to the donor.
            
            Personnel
            Most collection personnel involved in blood donation are certified phlebotomists. These personnel require a high school diploma and receive 1-2 months of classroom and hands-on training prior to becoming certified. Collection personnel may also be trained as LVNs, RNs, and EMTs, among others.
            
            Preparation
            In preparation for blood donation, donors should be well rested, eat a full meal, and drink plenty of non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages. Donors should refrain from heavy lifting, drinking alcohol, and smoking for several hours after donation.
            
            Technique
            After the donor screening questionnaire is completed, the donor will be evaluated by a medical receptionist. This evaluation includes an assessment of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature), an arm check looking for needle tracks and signs of injury or trauma, and a peripheral finger stick to check blood hemoglobin levels. Following the screening, the donor will proceed to the donor floor for collection. The venipuncture site will be scrubbed with a cleaning solution (either iodine or chlorhexidine), and the needle will be inserted into a peripheral (antecubital) vein in a sterile fashion. The donor is continually monitored during collection, and the needle is removed and pressure applied to the wound once the appropriate blood volume has been collected (450 ml).
            
            Complications
            Certified phlebotomists are required to perform blood donation. They are trained in the appropriate screening of potential blood donors, sterile collection methods, and management of the blood donation process. Adverse reactions are rare incidences in blood donation. The most common complication is the development of a local traumatic hematoma when the needle is removed from the vein. Holding local pressure and application of ice or cold compresses to the area can help to prevent the development or progression of hematomas. These hematomas are usually small and do not cause major problems, but rarely they can progress to cause damage to neighboring structures and tissue. Monitoring the hematoma for development of local damage is important.[8] 
            
            Perhaps the second most common adverse side effect of blood donation is syncope, which is most often vasovagal in nature. During syncopal episodes associated with blood donation, systolic blood pressure usually falls as does the pulse. The blood donor may endorse symptoms of weakness, sweating, dizziness, or pallor. Supportive measures should be immediately taken, and the donation paused or discontinued completely. Syncope may also occur post-donation and can be avoided by requiring the donor to sit in a reclined position for a few minutes, and when able, slowly moving to the upright position and moving to an area where they should be given something to eat and drink. Increased fluid intake and avoidance of alcoholic or caffeinated beverages should be encouraged over the few hours following donation to aid replenishing lost fluid volume.[8][14][15]
            
            One study showed that first-time donor status, young age, and female gender were associated with increased risk of adverse events. Although transient syncopal events may not be dangerous themselves, injuries sustained from falls due to syncope may result. Requiring resting and sitting while donating blood and after the donation is finished is vital to preventing these injuries. Unfortunately, donors who suffer an injury during their donation may be less likely to return for a repeat donation.[16][15]
            
            Nausea and vomiting are reported infrequently with blood donation. If encountered, supportive measures should be taken, and the donation should be paused. Overall, blood donation is a safe practice which many people view as an altruistic service they take great pride in. With little cost to themselves, they can benefit others' health care and even save lives.[8][17]
            
            Clinical Significance
            Blood donation and transfusion is a vital part of medicine in the treatment of hundreds of thousands of patients annually, and maintaining an adequate blood supply is an ongoing challenge as blood and derived blood products have limited shelf life. In the United States alone, estimates are that over 24 million whole blood and blood-derived products are transfused each year.[18] Also, perhaps a more important factor regarding maintaining the blood supply of the future is that it is dependent solely on volunteer donors as the source (US, varies by country).[19] Increasing restrictions on the donor pool related to infectious agents, more effective screening, the discovery of new pathogens, and changing donor eligibility and criteria are squeezing the donor supply.[20] Fortunately, however, recent emphasis on patient blood management and appropriate blood utilization has been effective in reducing demand and maintaining adequate blood supplies for future patients in need. [21]
            
            Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes
            It is necessary to guard and grow the blood supply and continue to actively recruit new donors, as well as encourage the return of prior donors, to meet the medical needs of our aging population. Hospitals and other establishments continue to create campaigns and motivators aimed at increasing the donor pool. These marketing strategies often center around promoting the idea of doing good for others, meeting a real medical need, or appealing to a sense of duty and service.[17][19][20] Collaboration between physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals is important for continued encouragement toward blood donation and educating others in both formal and informal settings regarding the benefits of blood donation and transfusion. During the blood donation process, protecting our blood donors from injury is not only important in and of itself but also important for preventing donor dropout and encouraging retention and recruitment.[16][15] 
            
            An Interprofessional Approach to Blood Donations
            
            It is important to appreciate that the aged population in the US is gradually increasing. Studies from Europe reveal that this also reduces the donor pool.[22] Further, the in-hospital need for blood has increased significantly over the past 3 decades. The younger population is often skeptical of healthcare services and may not participate in blood donation. Thus, to increase the pool of donors, an interprofessional team of healthcare workers who can educate and initiate blood donations campaigns is necessary. With changing demographics, physicians, pharmacists, nurses, laboratory technologists, and other allied healthcare workers all have an important role to play in boosting blood donations.[22] (Level V)
