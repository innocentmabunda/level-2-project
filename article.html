<h2>Indications</h2>
    <p>Blood donation for transfusion is a vital step in the management of many clinical problems, with the two primary indications being anemia and acute blood loss. Blood donation itself is also used to primarily treat a small subset of medical conditions. At the beginning of the 20th century, Karl Landsteiner identified ABO blood groups, at which time blood typing of individuals was only beginning to be adopted as a universally standard practice.[2] Due to the inability to prevent blood from clotting once removed from the donor and thus store and transfer blood to be delivered when needed later, transfusions were only carried out on a limited basis. Blood was transfused directly from donor to recipient without intervening storage or transport. This method worked for small numbers of patients and only on a small scale, as donors and recipients needed to be connected both in time and space. There was a time when lists of donors were maintained of persons locally available to be called in to donate to patients at any time as needed. Necessity drove the development of more flexible donation and storage practices when World War I began. "On-demand" blood donation was not feasible for such a large scale effort. Soldiers were dying of otherwise non-fatal wounds due mainly to the inability to perform a timely blood transfusion. 
    
    Concerted efforts to develop a means of storing and transferring blood to meet the war-time demands led to several discoveries. One, clotting was inhibited by adding citrate to the donated blood.[3] Second, glucose was added to the solution to allow the red blood cells to remain viable for several weeks when stored in refrigerated conditions.[4],[5] The first time blood was "banked" as is common practice currently, was when Captain Oswald Hope Robertson of the US Army Medical Corps collected Group O blood, combined it with glucose, and stored it before the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917. This was a pivotal shift from the prior practices of "direct" blood donation to "indirect" blood donation, importantly separating donors from their recipients geographically and temporally. This development made blood donation and transfusion a much more practical and useful medical intervention.[6]
    
    Allogeneic and autologous blood transfusion have many indications. More than 108 million units of red blood cells are transfused annually worldwide,[7] and as not all donated units are actually used, the number of donated units is higher still. Blood is donated for later transfusion either back to the donor or to another person, termed respectively "autologous" and "allogeneic" transfusion. The main indications for blood donation for transfusion include anemia and acute blood loss. Blood can also be donated for primary therapeutic purposes for the donor. This is called "therapeutic phlebotomy," or as it was known historically, "blood-letting." Unfortunately, this practice was used incorrectly for thousands of years as a supposed cure for all sorts of ailments. Currently, the main indications for blood donation as a primary therapeutic medical intervention include treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis or other hemoglobin synthesis or myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia and porphyria.[8]
    
    Another indication for blood donation is preparation for surgery; this is an example of autologous donation. Patients preparing for surgery who are foreseen to need intraoperative or postoperative red blood cell transfusion may be directed by their surgeon or treating physician to donate blood at least 72 hours before their surgery date to have on hand for autologous transfusion during the operation or postoperatively. The patient must have adequate hemoglobin (see contraindications section below for these parameters), and the donated unit is only allowed for autologous donation. Patients with suspected bacteremia or with at-risk related conditions are contraindicated for autologous donation. The autologous donation was a widely used practice in the 1980s to 1990s due to the increased fear of transfusion-transmitted HIV and hepatitis C infections.[9],[10] Increased safety with blood donation, handling, screening, and transfusion practices have thankfully made transfusion-related HIV and hepatitis infections exceedingly rare; due to this and other reasons, pre-operative autologous donation has lost popularity. Patients who have common alloantibodies for which finding adequate compatible blood supply from the general population remain the most compelling case to continue autologous blood donation. Other potential benefits include preserving allogeneic blood supply, reducing the risk of alloimmunization, reducing or eliminating the risk of transmitting allogeneic infections, and promoting transfusion acceptance in certain cases. Risks associated with autologous donation include procedural induced anemia, loss of donated units due to unforeseen circumstances, and possibly delay of necessary procedures. Ironically, this may result in an increased need for allogeneic transfusion in these patients.[10]
    
    Another way to donate blood is through the donation of umbilical cord blood. Cord blood has a much higher percentage of hematopoietic stem cells than non-cord blood and as such is an excellent source for hematopoeitic stem cell transplantation. Cord blood is collected at the time of delivery and processed and stored in blood banks that are specifically designed for cord blood for use at a later time.</p>
